Write a program that plays 100 iterations of Rock, Paper, Scissors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).
One player should always play randomly, the other should always choose rock. It should show at the end how many games each player has one and how many were a draw.

The code should have high test coverage.
Keep it simple - remember: we're not looking for the perfect "correct" solution, but a basis for discussion and development.

Technical requirements
Language: Java, tests in a JVM language of your choice
Approach: ideally "test-driven"
Please use local git (initially a “git init” in the project directory), so that we see a little of your working methods.
